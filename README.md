This is a spring-web project, using Spring Framework with Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and Thymeleaf.
I used the Spring Framework with Spring Boot and built it using Maven. Also the application allowed librarians to perform **CRUD** operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Spring Data JPA is also used for interacting with the database(i did with PostgreSQL).
The application has a simple and straightforward interface. 
Also for design, i used Bootstrap to create navbar and forms(register form).
